# DIndieMusicStreaming
Decentralized Music Streaming smart contract using ERC20 token

### Problem with centralized solution

* There is little transparency around the origins of artist payouts (e.g. number of plays, location, original gross payment before fees).
* There are layers of middlemen and significant time delay involved in payments to artists.

### How blockchain can help & What are current blockchain based solutions

* Peer-to-peer and instant monetization.
* Blockchain technology  could solve the  issue  of identifying a real copyright  holder  and  ease the  challenge  of tracking  derivative  works  (metadata)  through  the  blockchain. 
* Direct relationship between creators/ indie artist and fans.

### USP of this blockchain based solution

* Users / fans can pay directly to the indie artists (who receive almost 100% of the revenue, 90% to the artist 10% to the developer) without interference with 3rd party to get full access of their music. but also free access feature is still used to get music teaser from the artist but random like spotify did.
* When songs get reviewed by users/customers. The user will get benefit cashback discount (for example: 10%) for next purchase to the same artist limited to one review per song.
